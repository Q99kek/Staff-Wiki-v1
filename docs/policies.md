 <div id=policies-for-removal-from-the-team>

  <h2>Policies for removal from the team</h2>

It is important to keep in mind that acquiring any staff role does not mean permanent possession of it. Your staff permissions and roles can and will be revoked in the case of any of the following violations:

1. Deliberately sabotaging the project - will be followed up with a permanent ban upon discovery.

2. Breaking any of the regular rules - will be followed up with appropriate moderation measures depending on the severity of the violation.

3. Being inactive for over two weeks without any explanation or notice 
    - Inactivity is referred to as a complete and utter lack of participation on the project. Giving suggestions/ideas or simply inquiring knowledge on the project is considered active participation, while disappearing and not giving any input on the project is a case of inactivity which will be followed up with a warning after 1 week, and removal from the staff team after another week if no clarification on the reason or duration of absence from the project has been given.
    - Re-applying is still allowed, but you will be granted the starter role of the position you apply for and will have to work your way up to a higher position regardless of whether you've had it before.
    - To avoid removal due to inactivity, please inform Project Managers about the period of time you're going to be inactive for and the reason for it if comfortable sharing. You are allowed to take a break, but have the common courtesy to inform the team about it.

  <h2>Policies for public releases</h2>

Each new release should bring forward an improved and better optimized version of PBP.
While there is currently no set release schedule,  we should still strive to get a new release out as soon as possible while also making sure the release isn't rushed and has been properly tested and reviewed.

In order for a new public release to be approved, several requirements must be fulfilled. Those requirements include:

1. The release must accomplish given set of goals. There will be a list of general goals for each new release and they must all be properly implemented and tested before a new release can be initiated. The only exception to this would be in the case of specific goal(s) being excluded or postponed due to valid reasons.
Adding and optimizing aspects of the app unrelated to the given release goals isn't mandatory, but would be greatly appreciated.

2. The release must be initiated by a Lead Developer and approved by a Project Manager. Once the release goals are accomplished, a Lead Developer can request the release to be initiated and it will then be reviewed by one of the Project Managers to ensure everything is alright functionally and legally.

3. The release must be done at a time when there are at least a few developers online to ensure people get technical assistance/help if needed.

4. The release version number must be correct to avoid any confusion.

Once the release is done, feedback will be given by people and should be taken into consideration for future releases. In case of app-breaking bugs, a follow-up patch to fix the said issue(s) should be released within a week of the initial release or as soon as possible.

 <div id=legal-policies>

  <h2>Legal policies</h2>

In order to ensure the legality of PBP, we had to work around multiple copyright laws and utilize their loopholes. 
By legal definition, online piracy is the practice of downloading and distributing copyrighted works digitally without permission. PBP itself would be aiding in the distribution of copyrighted works, despite it only downloading from other piracy sources.

Ground for legal action would rise due a piece of legislation from the original [Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 US. Office Summary](https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf) that reads as following:

"Section 1201 divides technological measures into two categories: measures that prevent unauthorized access to a copyrighted work and measures that prevent unauthorized copying of a copyrighted work.
Making or selling devices or services that are used to circumvent either category of technological measure is prohibited in certain circumstances, described below. As to the act of circumvention in itself, the provision prohibits circumventing the first category of technological measures, but not the second.
This distinction was employed to assure that the public will have the continued ability to make fair use of copyrighted works. 
Since copying of a work may be a fair use under appropriate circumstances, section 1201 does not prohibit the act of circumventing a technological measure that prevents copying. By contrast, since the fair use doctrine is not a defense to the act of gaining unauthorized access to a work, the act of circumventing a technological measure in order to gain access is prohibited.
Section 1201 proscribes devices or services that fall within any one of the following three categories:
- they are primarily designed or produced to circumvent;
- they have only limited commercially significant purpose or use other
than to circumvent; or
- they are marketed for use in circumventing." 

Implementing plugins and removing PBPs piracy functionality out of the box would largely remove these concerns, as it wouldn't be "marketed" for use in circumventing, nor would it be "primarily designed or produced" to circumvent.

Also, the reason PBP most likely doesn't fall under the "they have only limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent" category is because this isn't a commercial operation or product, and therefore it has no inherent commercial purpose or use in the first place.

In conclusion, we are not legally held responsible for user-made plugins and by implementing those we can keep the purpose of the app while also not putting this project at legal risk. Its primary intent would be for storing games from legal sources such as Steam, GOG Games... and all the plugins that would utilize piracy sites would be entirely up to the individual user to enable.
