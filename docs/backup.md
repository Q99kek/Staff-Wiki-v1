<h1 class="title">Backup</h1>

Despite the server and the project itself being legally in the clear, there is always a possibility, albeit tiny, but still a valid possibility of the discord server getting shut down or nuked. To avoid the project itself suffering severe consequences if an event like that were to happen, a backup server on Divolt had been made.

Divolt is a self-hosted version of revolt.chat with a dedicated server, which makes it ideal for backup. The PBP Divolt server is barely used as of now, but in the case of the discord server being shut down we would completely move to it.

With that in mind, it would be optimal for every staff member to make an account on Divolt and join the server to acquire their roles as soon as possible.
