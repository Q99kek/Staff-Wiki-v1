<h1 class="title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

The following is a list of frequently asked questions by the staff team and the definitive and detailed response to them. 

 <div id="piracy">

  <h2>1. Why can't piracy be mentioned in the public repo?/ Why can't PBP be advertised as a piracy app?</h2>

While PBP was made with the intention of enabling a library system for pirated games, it cannot be openly advertised as such due to the legal and ethical concerns that would rise from such marketing. 

If the app were to be openly associated with pirating/pirated software, while also increasingly gaining popularity, the project would be become a target for DMCA strikes and even possible lawsuits. The discord server itself would be have an almost guaranteed chance to be terminated and that would cause significant communicational issues between the dev team and the community. 

While those concerns may not seem as apparent now, they would inevitably become an issue once the app gained significant following and publicity. It would be better to prevent those risks at the root than to watch them grow into problems we would have to consistently deal with in the future.

However, not publicly marketing it as a piracy app will not prevent it from reaching its initial target audience. PBP is well known and approved in other popular piracy communities such as FMHY (FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH), and it will continue to be advertised in those communities as what it was aimed to be.

  <h2>2. Why is there a need for plugins?</h2>

As mentioned in the previous question, PBP cannot be directly associated with or endorse any pirated software. Integrating search function for piracy sites into the app itself would be nothing short of openly admitting PBP supports and is associated with those sites.

Making plugins for the app is a way to work around this issue as it allows the users to use the app for what it was originally intended, while also not putting PBPs legality at risk because PBP is not held accountable for user-made plugins and the actions done with them.

The only downside to this is that the plugins themselves cannot be searched for within the app, and it's up to the user to find and install the plugin they need. However, that minor inconvenience will be dealt with in other piracy communities as they will release a list of all the safe and approved plugins for PBP.

 <div id="restrictions">

  <h2>3. Why are GitHub restrictions placed on developers?</h2>

Restrictions are there to ensure that the project goes according to plan and that there is no confusion or mistakes as a result of someone having permissions that require more knowledge and experience to properly apply than they currently have. 

Junior Developers are going to spend the most time inquiring information about the project and getting used to the developmental structure of it. With that in mind, there is a lot of room for error when adding or creating new files so those must be applied as PRs (pull requests) and reviewed/approved by more experienced developers, such as Senior Developers or Lead Developers. 

The restrictions ease up with each promotion. Senior Developers are able to review and approve PRs since they've proven their experience and knowledge about the project, as well as their ability to assist less experienced developers and review their code. However, they still cannot merge and create repositories as those can cause major functional issues if used improperly and/or without the approval from Lead Developers/Project Managers.

Lead Developers have the most permissions as they're essentially leading the entire development team and have proven to be trustworthy. However, they still cannot create repositories and have to discuss the concept of those with Project Managers to ensure that no repositories can be created without the knowledge and approval of Project Managers.

Nobody has the permission to commit to main as that's an objectively problematic and unnecessary permission to give.

 <div id="advertising">

  <h2>4. Can I contribute to the project by advertising?</h2>
No. Contributing to the project by advertising, in the sense of making promotional content for the app itself, is currently heavily discouraged as openly advertising it as a piracy app would be problematic (see the first question of FAQ) and advertising it as a library app would most likely not get it any significant attention. 

It's currently only advertised on the basis of being mentioned in other piracy communities and recommended to people who might be interested in it, such as any friends you have that commonly pirate games and could benefit from an app like PBP. 
It is recommended to stick with that kind of advertising, at least at the current stage of the project.
